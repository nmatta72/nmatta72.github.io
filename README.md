## Nikita Matta - Data Science Portfolio

Thanks for checking out my Github site! Here you'll find links to machine learning projects that I've completed in my master's program, along with other personal projects that I picked up along the way. 

### Machine Learning

I found my passion for machine learning on a specific project during my master's - the Pump It Up Competition on drivendata.org 
Check out the link below for my first machine learning pipeline in jupyter notebook, which documents my thought process throughout the code:

### Data Visualization

Here are some visualizations I did in R using ggplot:

I came across D3JS in my data visualization class. D3JS is a JavaScript library to produce dynamic and interactive visualizations in web browsers - it was a good introduction to the challenging language of JavaScript. Check out the link below for a dynamic visualization of net migration in European countries:
