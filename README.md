## Nikita Matta - Data Science Portfolio

Thanks for checking out my Github site! Here you'll find links to machine learning projects that I've completed in my master's program, along with other personal projects that I picked up along the way. 

### Machine Learning

I found my passion for machine learning on a specific project during my master's - the Pump It Up Competition on drivendata.org 
Check out the link below for my machine learning pipeline in jupyter notebook, which documents my thought process throughout the code:

_Competition rank: 1725 out of 8996 contestants_

I also did a timed Kaggle competition during my master's - the bike sharing demand forecasting competiton found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-dsc/leaderboard. This was my first timed competition in which I had 3 hours to clean the data and test models. Check out the link below for a link to my code:

_Competition rank: 5 out of 26 contestants (late submission)_

I took on a NLP challenge in the Real or Not Kaggle competition - found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/leaderboard. Throughout this challenge, I explored different ways clean textual data from tweets and experimented with models that are most efficient for text classification. Check out the link below for my code:

_Competition rank: 932 out of 2549 contestants_

### Packaging a Library

I had the opportunity to combine my machine learning skills with some packaging features of Python, namely joblib, to execute a classification model. The purpose of this project is to make the model usable for the end user, have a look at the code below to see how this was executed:

### Data Visualization

#### R - ggplot

Here are some visualizations I did in R using ggplot:

#### Tableau

I've created dashboards on Tableau using datasets from other projects during my master's Check out the link below which contains two dashboards - the Exploratory Analysis Dashboard and the County Analysis Dashboard, which contains interesting oil production information within a county. Please note this is a .twb file

#### D3.js

I came across D3JS in my data visualization class. D3JS is a JavaScript library to produce dynamic and interactive visualizations in web browsers - it was a good introduction to the challenging language of JavaScript. Check out the link below for a dynamic visualization of net migration in European countries:
